# SLR_FAIR-for-Explainable-ML
In this repository we have uploaded the research papers of our SLR study.

The folder of MyEndnote_SLR_FAIR contains the list of the papers found from the search queries in these scientific databases: Scopus, IEEE and WOS. 

In our SLR, we have also analyzed papers from Nature.com, but it is not possible to export the results of the search queries from there.
Hence, we had to access the papers one by one by reading it in the database and then only export the ones that meet the inclusion criterias.

The folder selected papers contain the list of the final selected primary studies.
